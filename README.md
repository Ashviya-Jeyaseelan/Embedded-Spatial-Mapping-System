# Embedded-Spatial-Mapping-System
The Embedded Spatial Mapping System is a project designed for Microprocessor Systems Project at McMaster University. (Grade: A+)

The project implements a device that can map and visualize a given space by plotting distance measurements in a three-dimensional space, using an arm-based microcontroller, stepper motor, and Time of Flight (ToF) sensor. The system employs UART protocols to transmit data and I2C communication to initiate measurements in C, then visualizing the collected data with Open3D in Python.
